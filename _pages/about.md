<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello, I am Peiyuan Gong (公培元, in Chinese). Feel free to call me Pei Yuan.
I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/index.htm), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Jiaxin Mao](https://sites.google.com/site/maojiaxin/).
Before that, I received M.Eng and B.Eng degrees in Computer Science and Technology from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://bit.edu.cn/) in 2023 and from [Zhengzhou University](http://www.zzu.edu.cn/) in 2020, respectively.

My research focuses on information retrieval and human-AI interaction, having published several papers at the top international AI conferences such as SIGIR, WWW, ACL, EMNLP. 
Currently, I am dedicated to exploring the next generation of search engine with large language models.

<span style="color: red;"> Currently, I am the CEO of **[WanYan (万言， in Chinese)](https://kbox.aicelv.com)**, an AI+Search startup. </span> Our product is built around the Agentic SERP, where every user query triggers parallel responses from multiple AI agents. We believe that this approach can identify a near-optimal solution for user queries from the current pool of agents.
Moreover, for merchants without agent-building capabilities, we provide virtual sales agents that integrate enterprise knowledge and engage users within the Agentic SERP to recommend their products.

We are excited to partner with AI agents of diverse capabilities on WanYan, offering them meaningful exposure and real business growth. If you’d like to sell your services or products on our platform, get in touch with us. We’ll create a custom sales agent for you for free—so you can reach more users and dramatically boost your lead conversion rates.
